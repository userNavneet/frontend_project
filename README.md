reimagining and redesigning the Nike website homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of this project was to enhance the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) by implementing a modern, visually appealing, and responsive design while maintaining the brand identity of Nike.
The redesigned homepage focuses on interactive elements, smooth animations, and an intuitive layout to improve usability and engagement. Using HTML, the website structure was carefully crafted to ensure semantic correctness and accessibility. CSS was utilized to implement a modern color scheme, custom typography, flexbox/grid-based layouts, and hover effects, ensuring a sleek and professional look. JavaScript played a crucial role in adding interactivity, such as dynamic product carousels, animated transitions, and a responsive navigation bar.
The reimagined design prioritizes user-centric navigation, optimizing the homepage for various screen sizes through responsive design techniques. A focus was placed on minimalism, high-quality imagery, and fluid animations to create a more engaging shopping experience. This project not only strengthened technical expertise in frontend web development but also emphasized the importance of UI/UX principles in crafting a visually appealing and functional e-commerce interface.
